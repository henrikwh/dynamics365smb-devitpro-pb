# Operational Limits for Business Central Online

To ensure the availability and quality of Business Central services, there are limits on certain operations. This article describes the limits and, in some cases, the strategy behind them. 

> [!TIP]
> Telemetry is gathered on some of the operations that have a limit. The telemetry provides insight into operations for which limits were exceeded. For more information, see [Monitoring and Analyzing Telemetry](telemetry-overview.md).

<!--
For [!INCLUDE[prod_short](../developer/includes/prod_short.md)] online, you can't change these limits, but it's useful to be aware of them. For on-premises installation, you can adjust most of the limits by configuring the [!INCLUDE[server](../developer/includes/server.md)].-->
